# What's this then?

It's the 28th lab exercise assigned as part of a software development course. This one was just to practice using built-in JavaScript enumerators, rather than writing a bunch of loops out manually. The scenario being modelled here was a cinema showing a range of films, which have a basic set of properties to interact with.

The brief outlining what we were to do is available in `task.md` and some prewritten start code is in `startpoint`.

# What do I do with it?

Not a whole lot. To do anything much at all, you'll at least need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you have that installed, you can run the tests from a terminal to check whether they pass by installing the required dependencies...

`npm i`

... then running...

`npm test`

... and that's pretty much it, unless you want to mess around with the source code yourself, which you can do if you fancy. Just don't blame me if you break anything, awright? (Yeah, I know, no licence. I'm a simpleton. I know.)
